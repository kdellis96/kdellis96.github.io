<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Kristen. I'm a senior computer engineering student here at NCAT. 
I will graduate in December of 2024. I work in the GRADS-4C reserch group as well as a part-time tutor for younger kids.
 In my spare time, I like to play piano, play video games, read, and any outdoor activities. I'm the oldest of 6 children. 
My siblings, my nephew, and myself are pictured below.</p>
